# Quotes 

## Season Two

### "He Shall, from Time to Time..."

#### Mrs. Bartlett to Mallory McGarry

> "Don't go for the geniuses. They never want to sleep."

### Midterms (S02E03)

#### President Bartlett to Reporter

> "I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here. I'm 
> interested in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in 
> Exodus 21:7. She's a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and always 
> clears the table when it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? 

> While thinking about that, can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, 
> insists on working on the Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put 
> to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the 
> police? 

> Here's one that's really important, 'cause we've got a lot of sports 
> fans in this town. Touching the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean, 
> Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins 
> still play football? 

> Can Notre Dame? 

> Can West Point? 

> Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my brother, John, for 
> planting different crops side by side? 

> Can I burn my mother in a small family gathering for wearing garments made 
> from two different threads? Think about those questions, would you? 

> One last thing, while you may be mistaking this for your monthly 
> meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in this building, when the President 
> stands, nobody sits."



### Noël (S02E03)

#### Leo to Josh
    
> "This guy's walking down the street when he falls in a hole. The walls are so 
> steep he can't get out. 
    
> A doctor passes by and the guy shouts up, 'Hey you. Can you help me out?' The 
> doctor writes a prescription, throws it down in the hole and moves on. 
    
> Then a priest comes along and the guy shouts up, 'Father, I'm down in this 
> hole can you help me out?' 
> The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on. 

> Then a friend walks by, 'Hey, Joe, it's me can you help me out?' And the 
> friend jumps in the hole. Our guy says, 'Are you stupid? Now we're both down 
> here.' 

> The friend says, 'Yeah, but I've been down here before and I know the way out.'" 

### Bartlett's Third State of the Union

#### Margaret to Secretary of State

> "I'm sorry for interrupting but LEO McGarry was wondering if you could come 
> say hello to an old friend of his."

### The War at Home (S02E14)

#### Joey Lucas to Josh

> "Otherwise you're like the French radical watching the crowd run by and
> saying 'There go my people, I must find out where they are going so I can lead 
> them.'"

#### Leo McGarry to President Bartlett

> "If I could put myself anywhere in time it would be the Cabinet room on 
> August 4, 1964, when our ships were attacked by North Vietnam in the Tonkin 
> Gulf. I'd say, 'Mr. President...don't do it. You're considering authorizing a 
> massive commitment of troops and throwing in our lot with torturers and 
> panderers. Leaders without principle and soldiers without conviction with no 
> clear mission, and no end in sight.' This war is at home. The casualties are 
> in our prisons, and not our hospitals. The amount of money the American 
> government is spending in Columbia is the exact same amount American consumers 
> are spending buying drugs from Columbia. We're funding both sides of this war 
> and we'll never win it that way."

### Somebody;s Going to Emergency, Somebody;s going to Jail

#### Sam to Donna 

> "It was high treason, and it mattered a great deal! This country is an idea, 
> and one that's lit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea 
> is not just a crime against the living! This ground holds the graves of people 
> who died for it, who gave what Lincoln called the last full measure of 
> devotion. Of fidelity. You understand the last full measure of devotion to... 
> Treason against them is..."

### Stackhouse Filibuster

#### Jhn Hoynes to Toby

> "Toby, the total tonnage of what I know that you don't could stun a team of 
> oxen in its tracks. Good night."

"I wanted to ask you a couple of questions while I had you here. I'm interested 
in selling my youngest daughter into slavery as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. She's 
a Georgetown sophomore, speaks fluent Italian, and always clears the table when 
it was her turn. What would a good price for her be? While thinking about that, 
can I ask another? My Chief of Staff, Leo McGarry, insists on working on the 
Sabbath, Exodus 35:2, clearly says he should be put to death. Am I morally 
obligated to kill him myself or is it okay to call the police? Here's one that's 
really important, 'cause we've got a lot of sports fans in this town. Touching 
the skin of a dead pig makes one unclean, Leviticus 11:7. If they promise to 
wear gloves, can the Washington Redskins still play football? Can Notre Dame? 
Can West Point? Does the whole town really have to be together to stone my 
brother, John, for planting different crops side by side? Can I burn my mother 
in a small family gathering for wearing garments made from two different 
threads? Think about those questions, would you? One last thing, while you may 
be mistaking this for your monthly meeting of the Ignorant Tightass Club, in 
this building, when the President stands, nobody sits." - President bartlett

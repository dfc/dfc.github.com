LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Simon Glik was arrested for using his cell phone's
digital video camera to film several police officers arresting a young
man on the Boston Common. The charges against Glik, which included
violation of Massachusetts's wiretap statute and two other state-law
offenses, were subsequently judged baseless and were dismissed. Glik
then brought this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that his arrest
for filming the officers constituted a violation of his rights under the
First and Fourth Amendments.

In this interlocutory appeal, the defendant police officers challenge an
order of the district court denying them qualified immunity on Glik's
constitutional claims. We conclude, based on the facts alleged, that
Glik was exercising clearly-established First Amendment rights in
filming the officers in a public space, and that his clearly-established
Fourth Amendment rights were violated by his arrest without probable
cause. We therefore affirm.

I.

We recite the pertinent facts based upon the allegations of the
complaint, Asociación de Subscripción Conjunta del Seguro de
Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.
2007), "accepting all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true,"
Sanchez v. Pereira-Castillo, 590 F.3d 31, 36, 52 n.15 (1st Cir. 2009).

As he was walking past the Boston Common on the evening of October 1,
2007, Simon Glik caught sight of three police officers -- the individual
defendants here -- arresting a young man. Glik heard another bystander
say something to the effect of, "You are hurting him, stop." Concerned
that the officers were employing excessive force to effect the arrest,
Glik stopped roughly ten feet away and began recording video footage of
the arrest on his cell phone.

After placing the suspect in handcuffs, one of the officers turned to
Glik and said, "I think you have taken enough pictures." Glik replied,
"I am recording this. I saw you punch him." An officer
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote1',%20WPFootnote1%20))

then approached Glik and asked if Glik's cell phone recorded audio. When
Glik affirmed that he was recording audio, the officer placed him in
handcuffs, arresting him for, inter alia, unlawful audio recording in
violation of Massachusetts's wiretap statute. Glik was taken to the
South Boston police station. In the course of booking, the police
confiscated Glik's cell phone and a computer flash drive and held them
as evidence.

Glik was eventually charged with violation of the wiretap statute, Mass.
Gen. Laws ch. 272, § 99(C)(1), disturbing the peace, id. ch. 272, §
53(b), and aiding in the escape of a prisoner, id. ch. 268, § 17.
Acknowledging lack of probable cause for the last of these charges, the
Commonwealth voluntarily dismissed the count of aiding in the escape of
a prisoner. In February 2008, in response to Glik's motion to dismiss,
the Boston Municipal Court disposed of the remaining two charges for
disturbance of the peace and violation of the wiretap statute. With
regard to the former, the court noted that the fact that the "officers
were unhappy they were being recorded during an arrest . . . does not
make a lawful exercise of a First Amendment right a crime." Likewise,
the court found no probable cause supporting the wiretap charge, because
the law requires a secret recording and the officers admitted that Glik
had used his cell phone openly and in plain view to obtain the video and
audio recording.

Glik filed an internal affairs complaint with the Boston Police
Department following his arrest, but to no avail. The Department did not
investigate his complaint or initiate disciplinary action against the
arresting officers. In February 2010, Glik filed a civil rights action
against the officers and the City of Boston in the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint included
claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of Glik's First and Fourth
Amendment rights, as well as state-law claims under the Massachusetts
Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, § 11I, and for malicious
prosecution.

The defendants moved to dismiss Glik's complaint under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that the allegations of the complaint
failed to adequately support Glik's claims and that the officers were
entitled to qualified immunity "because it is not well-settled that he
had a constitutional right to record the officers." At a hearing on the
motion, the district court focused on the qualified immunity defense,
noting that it presented the closest issue. After hearing argument from
the parties, the court orally denied the defendants' motion, concluding
that "in the First Circuit . . . this First Amendment right publicly to
record the activities of police officers on public business is
established."

This timely appeal followed. Denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified
immunity grounds, unlike denial of a typical motion to dismiss, is
immediately appealable on interlocutory review. Garnier v. Rodríguez,
506 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2007); cf. Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227
(1991) (per curiam) (stressing "the importance of resolving immunity
questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation"). We limit our
review to the issue of qualified immunity, Garnier, 506 F.3d at 25,
which is a legal determination that we review de novo, Raiche v.
Pietroski, 623 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2010).

II.

Long-standing principles of constitutional litigation entitle public
officials to qualified immunity from personal liability arising out of
actions taken in the exercise of discretionary functions. See Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 807 (1982); Barton v. Clancy, 632 F.3d 9, 21
(1st Cir. 2011). The qualified immunity doctrine "balances two important
interests -- the need to hold public officials accountable when they
exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from
harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties
reasonably." Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009). We apply a
two-prong analysis in determining questions of qualified immunity.
Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 2009). These prongs,
which may be resolved in any order, Pearson, 555 U.S. at 236, require
that we decide "(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff
make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether
the right was 'clearly established' at the time of the defendant's
alleged violation," Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269.

The latter analysis of whether a right was "clearly established" further
divides into two parts: "(1) 'the clarity of the law at the time of the
alleged civil rights violation,' and (2) whether, given the facts of the
particular case, 'a reasonable defendant would have understood that his
conduct violated the plaintiff['s] constitutional rights.'" Barton, 632
F.3d at 22 (alteration in original) (quoting Maldonado, 568 F.3d at
269). An affirmative finding on these inquiries does "not require a case
directly on point, but existing precedent must have placed the . . .
constitutional question beyond debate." Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct.
2074, 2083 (2011). At bottom, "the salient question is whether the state
of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant fair
warning that his particular conduct was unconstitutional." Maldonado,
568 F.3d at 269.

On appeal, appellants
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote2',%20WPFootnote2%20))

argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on each of Glik's
constitutional claims and, accordingly, that the district erred in
denying their motion to dismiss.
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote3',%20WPFootnote3%20))

Their arguments track the two parts of the "clearly established right"
analysis. With regard to the First Amendment claim, appellants dispute
the clarity of the law establishing a First Amendment right to record
police officers carrying out their public duties. On the Fourth
Amendment claim, appellants contend that, in light of Massachusetts case
law interpreting the state's wiretap statute, a reasonable officer would
have believed there was probable cause to arrest Glik, and thus would
not have understood that the arrest would violate the Fourth Amendment.
We examine each argument in turn.

A. Immunity from Glik's First Amendment Claim

\1. Were Glik's First Amendment Rights Violated?

The First Amendment issue here is, as the parties frame it, fairly
narrow: is there a constitutionally protected right to videotape police
carrying out their duties in public? Basic First Amendment principles,
along with case law from this and other circuits, answer that question
unambiguously in the affirmative.

It is firmly established that the First Amendment's aegis extends
further than the text's proscription on laws "abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press," and encompasses a range of conduct related to
the gathering and dissemination of information. As the Supreme Court has
observed, "the First Amendment goes beyond protection of the press and
the self-expression of individuals to prohibit government from limiting
the stock of information from which members of the public may draw."
First Nat'l Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 783 (1978); see also Stanley
v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969) ("It is . . . well established that
the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.").
An important corollary to this interest in protecting the stock of
public information is that "[t]here is an undoubted right to gather news
'from any source by means within the law.'" Houchins v. KQED, Inc., 438
U.S. 1, 11 (1978) (quoting Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 681-82
(1972)).

The filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public
place, including police officers performing their responsibilities, fits
comfortably within these principles. Gathering information about
government officials in a form that can readily be disseminated to
others serves a cardinal First Amendment interest in protecting and
promoting "the free discussion of governmental affairs." Mills v.
Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966). Moreover, as the Court has noted,
"[f]reedom of expression has particular significance with respect to
government because '[i]t is here that the state has a special incentive
to repress opposition and often wields a more effective power of
suppression.'" First Nat'l Bank, 435 U.S. at 777 n.11 (alteration in
original) (quoting Thomas Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First
Amendment 9 (1966)). This is particularly true of law enforcement
officials, who are granted substantial discretion that may be misused to
deprive individuals of their liberties. Cf. Gentile v. State Bar of
Nev., 501 U.S. 1030, 1035-36 (1991) (observing that "[t]he public has an
interest in [the] responsible exercise" of the discretion granted police
and prosecutors). Ensuring the public's right to gather information
about their officials not only aids in the uncovering of abuses, see id.
at 1034-35 (recognizing a core First Amendment interest in "the
dissemination of information relating to alleged governmental
misconduct"), but also may have a salutary effect on the functioning of
government more generally, see Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court, 478
U.S. 1, 8 (1986) (noting that "many governmental processes operate best
under public scrutiny").

In line with these principles, we have previously recognized that the
videotaping of public officials is an exercise of First Amendment
liberties. In Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 1999), a local
journalist brought a § 1983 claim arising from his arrest in the course
of filming officials in the hallway outside a public meeting of a
historic district commission. The commissioners had objected to the
plaintiff's filming. Id. at 18. When the plaintiff refused to desist, a
police officer on the scene arrested him for disorderly conduct. Id. The
charges were later dismissed. Id. Although the plaintiff's subsequent §
1983 suit against the arresting police officer was grounded largely in
the Fourth Amendment and did not include a First Amendment claim, we
explicitly noted, in rejecting the officer's appeal from a denial of
qualified immunity, that because the plaintiff's journalistic activities
"were peaceful, not performed in derogation of any law, and done in the
exercise of his First Amendment rights, [the officer] lacked the
authority to stop them." Id. at 25 (emphasis added).

Our recognition that the First Amendment protects the filming of
government officials in public spaces accords with the decisions of
numerous circuit and district courts. See, e.g., Smith v. City of
Cumming, 212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000) ("The First Amendment
protects the right to gather information about what public officials do
on public property, and specifically, a right to record matters of
public interest."); Fordyce v. City of Seattle, 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th
Cir. 1995) (recognizing a "First Amendment right to film matters of
public interest"); Demarest v. Athol/Orange Cmty. Television, Inc., 188
F. Supp. 2d 82, 94-95 (D. Mass. 2002) (finding it "highly probable" that
filming of a public official on street outside his home by contributors
to public access cable show was protected by the First Amendment, and
noting that, "[a]t base, plaintiffs had a constitutionally protected
right to record matters of public interest"); Channel 10, Inc. v.
Gunnarson, 337 F. Supp. 634, 638 (D. Minn. 1972) (holding that police
interference with television newsman's filming of crime scene and
seizure of video camera constituted unlawful prior restraint under First
Amendment); cf. Schnell v. City of Chi., 407 F.2d 1084, 1085 (7th Cir.
1969) (reversing dismissal for failure to state a claim of suit claiming
police interference with news reporters and photographers'
"constitutional right to gather and report news, and to photograph news
events" under the First Amendment (internal quotation mark omitted)),
overruled on other grounds by City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507
(1973); Connell v. Town of Hudson, 733 F. Supp. 465, 471-72 (D.N.H.
1990) (denying qualified immunity from First Amendment claim to police
chief who prevented freelance photographer from taking pictures of car
accident).

It is of no significance that the present case, unlike Iacobucci and
many of those cited above, involves a private individual, and not a
reporter, gathering information about public officials. The First
Amendment right to gather news is, as the Court has often noted, not one
that inures solely to the benefit of the news media; rather, the
public's right of access to information is coextensive with that of the
press. Houchins, 438 U.S. at 16 (Stewart, J., concurring) (noting that
the Constitution "assure[s] the public and the press equal access once
government has opened its doors"); Branzburg, 408 U.S. at 684 ("[T]he
First Amendment does not guarantee the press a constitutional right of
special access to information not available to the public generally.").
Indeed, there are several cases involving private individuals among the
decisions from other courts recognizing the First Amendment right to
film. See, e.g., Smith, 212 F.3d 1332; Robinson v. Fetterman, 378 F.
Supp. 2d 534 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (holding that arrest of individual filming
police activities from private property violated First Amendment);
Cirelli v. Town of Johnston Sch. Dist., 897 F. Supp. 663 (D.R.I. 1995)
(holding that teacher had a right under the First Amendment to videotape
potentially hazardous working conditions at school, which were a matter
of public concern). Moreover, changes in technology and society have
made the lines between private citizen and journalist exceedingly
difficult to draw. The proliferation of electronic devices with
video-recording capability means that many of our images of current
events come from bystanders with a ready cell phone or digital camera
rather than a traditional film crew, and news stories are now just as
likely to be broken by a blogger at her computer as a reporter at a
major newspaper. Such developments make clear why the news-gathering
protections of the First Amendment cannot turn on professional
credentials or status.

To be sure, the right to film is not without limitations. It may be
subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. See Smith,
212 F.3d at 1333. We have no occasion to explore those limitations here,
however. On the facts alleged in the complaint, Glik's exercise of his
First Amendment rights fell well within the bounds of the Constitution's
protections. Glik filmed the defendant police officers in the Boston
Common, the oldest city park in the United States and the apotheosis of
a public forum. In such traditional public spaces, the rights of the
state to limit the exercise of First Amendment activity are "sharply
circumscribed." Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460
U.S. 37, 45 (1983). Moreover, as in Iacobucci, the complaint indicates
that Glik "filmed [the officers] from a comfortable remove" and "neither
spoke to nor molested them in any way" (except in directly responding to
the officers when they addressed him). 193 F.3d at 25. Such peaceful
recording of an arrest in a public space that does not interfere with
the police officers' performance of their duties is not reasonably
subject to limitation.

In our society, police officers are expected to endure significant
burdens caused by citizens' exercise of their First Amendment rights.
See City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461 (1987) ("[T]he First
Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and
challenge directed at police officers."). Indeed, "[t]he freedom of
individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without
thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which
we distinguish a free nation from a police state." Id. at 462-63. The
same restraint demanded of law enforcement officers in the face of
"provocative and challenging" speech, id. at 461 (quoting Terminiello v.
Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949)), must be expected when they are merely
the subject of videotaping that memorializes, without impairing, their
work in public spaces.

\2. Was the Right to Film Clearly Established?

Though the "clearly established" inquiry does "not require a case
directly on point," al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. at 2083, we have such a case in
Iacobucci. What is particularly notable about Iacobucci is the brevity
of the First Amendment discussion, a characteristic found in other
circuit opinions that have recognized a right to film government
officials or matters of public interest in public space. See Smith, 212
F.3d at 1333; Fordyce, 55 F.3d at 439. This terseness implicitly speaks
to the fundamental and virtually self-evident nature of the First
Amendment's protections in this area. Cf. Lee v. Gregory, 363 F.3d 931,
936 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that some constitutional violations are
"self-evident" and do not require particularized case law to
substantiate them). We thus have no trouble concluding that "the state
of the law at the time of the alleged violation gave the defendant[s]
fair warning that [their] particular conduct was unconstitutional."
Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269.

We find unavailing the two cases principally relied upon by the
appellants in arguing that the First Amendment right to film was not
clearly established at the time of the arrest, both of which were
decided after Glik's arrest. The first is an unpublished per curiam
opinion from the Fourth Circuit that summarily concludes, with no
discussion of the facts or relevant law, that the "right to record
police activities on public property was not clearly established in this
circuit at the time of the alleged conduct." Szymecki v. Houck, 353 F.
App'x 852 (4th Cir. 2009). Such unpublished opinions "have no
precedential force," Merrimac Paper Co. v. Harrison (In re Merrimac
Paper Co.), 420 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v.
King, 628 F.3d 693, 700 n.3 (4th Cir. 2011) (same), and the absence of
substantive discussion deprives Szymecki of any marginal persuasive
value it might otherwise have had.

The second case appellants cite is a Third Circuit opinion finding the
right to film not clearly established in the context of a traffic stop,
characterized as an "inherently dangerous situation[]." Kelly v. Borough
of Carlisle, 622 F.3d 248, 262 (3d Cir. 2010). Kelly is clearly
distinguishable on its facts; a traffic stop is worlds apart from an
arrest on the Boston Common in the circumstances alleged. Nonetheless,
even if these cases were to establish a circuit split with respect to
the clarity of the First Amendment's protections in the situation before
us, that split would not undermine our conclusion that the right
violated by appellants was clearly established in this circuit at the
time of Glik's arrest. See Newman v. Massachusetts, 884 F.2d 19, 25 (1st
Cir. 1989) (finding constitutional right clearly established in the
First Circuit despite "recogni[tion] that the courts are not yet
unanimous on whether this . . . right exists").

In summary, though not unqualified, a citizen's right to film government
officials, including law enforcement officers, in the discharge of their
duties in a public space is a basic, vital, and well-established liberty
safeguarded by the First Amendment. Accordingly, we hold that the
district court did not err in denying qualified immunity to the
appellants on Glik's First Amendment claim.

B. Immunity from Glik's Fourth Amendment Claim

\1. Were Glik's Fourth Amendment Rights Violated?

The existence of a Fourth Amendment violation on the facts alleged here
turns on a question of Massachusetts law. The Fourth Amendment requires
that an arrest be grounded in probable cause, Martínez-Rodríguez v.
Guevara, 597 F.3d 414, 420 (1st Cir. 2010), i.e., that, "at the time of
the arrest, the 'facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge
. . . [were] sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of
reasonable caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the
suspect [had] committed, [was] committing, or [was] about to commit an
offense,'" Holder v. Town of Sandown, 585 F.3d 500, 504 (1st Cir. 2009)
(quoting Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 37 (1979)). The thrust of
Glik's Fourth Amendment claim is that the appellants lacked any such
probable cause that Glik had violated state law at the time of arrest.
The appellants argue, to the contrary, that the allegations of the
complaint establish probable cause that Glik violated Massachusetts's
wiretap statute.
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote4',%20WPFootnote4%20))

Upon examination of the statute and relevant case law from
Massachusetts's Supreme Judicial Court, we disagree.

Massachusetts's wiretap statute makes it a crime to "willfully commit[]
an interception . . . of any wire or oral communication." Mass. Gen.
Laws ch. 272, § 99(C)(1). As the Supreme Judicial Court has noted, this
statute sweeps more broadly than comparable laws in other jurisdictions,
in that its prohibition is not restricted to the recording of
communications that are made with a reasonable expectation of privacy.
See Commonwealth v. Hyde, 750 N.E.2d 963, 967-68 & n.5 (Mass. 2001).
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote5',%20WPFootnote5%20))

The critical limiting term in the statute is "interception," defined to
mean "to secretly hear, secretly record, or aid another to secretly hear
or secretly record the contents of any wire or oral communication
through the use of any intercepting device by any person other than a
person given prior authority by all parties to such communication." Id.
§ 99(B)(4).

The relevant question, then, is whether, on the facts alleged in the
complaint, Glik "secretly" videotaped the appellant officers.
[![Footnote](/images/footnoteicon.gif)](javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote6',%20WPFootnote6%20))

The Supreme Judicial Court has held that a recording is "secret" unless
the subject has "actual knowledge" of the fact of recording.
Commonwealth v. Jackson, 349 N.E.2d 337, 340 (Mass. 1976). It has also
made clear that "actual knowledge" can be proven by "objective
manifestations of knowledge" to "avoid the problems involved in
speculating as to the [subject's] subjective state of mind." Id. at
340-41. Moreover, the court has noted that "actual knowledge" does not
require that there be any explicit acknowledgment of or reference to the
fact of the recording. Id. at 340 ("[T]he person recording the
conversation [need not] confirm the [subject's] apparent awareness by
acknowledging the fact of the intercepting device."). Thus, in Hyde,
where the defendant was convicted of a wiretap violation for secretly
recording a traffic stop, the Supreme Judicial Court explained that "the
recording would not have been secret" within the meaning of the statute
if the defendant had simply "held the tape recorder in plain sight." 750
N.E.2d at 971. The unmistakable logic of Hyde, building on Jackson, is
that the secrecy inquiry turns on notice, i.e., whether, based on
objective indicators, such as the presence of a recording device in
plain view, one can infer that the subject was aware that she might be
recorded.

Commonwealth v. Rivera, 833 N.E.2d 1113 (Mass. 2005), forcefully
illustrates this point. There, a criminal defendant argued for
suppression under the wiretap statute of an audio recording by a
convenience store security camera, on the theory that he lacked actual
knowledge that the security cameras recorded audio as well as video.
Although the case was resolved on other grounds, four of the seven
justices of the Supreme Judicial Court concurred to note that the
defendant's unawareness of the audio recording capabilities of the
security cameras did not render the recordings "secret" under the
wiretap statute where the cameras were in plain sight. Id. at 1125
(Cowin, J., concurring in part) ("That the defendant did not know the
camera also included an audio component does not convert this otherwise
open recording into the type of 'secret' interception prohibited by the
Massachusetts wiretap statute."); id. at 1130 (Cordy, J., concurring)
("Just because a robber with a gun may not realize that the surveillance
camera pointed directly at him is recording both his image and his voice
does not . . . make the recording a 'secret' one within the meaning and
intent of the statute.").

The complaint alleges that Glik "openly record[ed] the police officers"
with his cell phone, and further that "the police officers admitted Mr.
Glik was publicly and openly recording them." On its face, this conduct
falls plainly outside the type of clandestine recording targeted by the
wiretap statute. See Jackson, 349 N.E.2d at 339 ("While we recognize
that [the wiretap statute] is designed to control the use of electronic
surveillance devices by private individuals because of the serious
threat they pose to 'the privacy of all citizens,' (§ 99A), it is clear
that the Legislature intended that the statutory restrictions be
applicable only to the secret use of such devices." (emphasis added)).
Moreover, not only does Hyde (along with the Rivera concurrences)
indicate that the use of a recording device in "plain sight," as here,
constitutes adequate objective evidence of actual knowledge of the
recording, but here the police officers made clear through their conduct
that they knew Glik was recording them. Specifically, one of the police
officers approached Glik after the suspect had been handcuffed and told
him, "I think you have taken enough pictures."

The officers protest that Glik's use of a cell phone was insufficient to
put them on notice of the recording. They note that a cell phone, unlike
the tape recorder used in Hyde, has numerous discrete functions, such as
text messaging, internet browsing, video gaming, and photography, and
thus the fact of an individual holding out a cell phone in front of his
body is of indeterminate significance. The argument suffers from factual
as well as legal flaws. The allegations of the complaint indicate that
the officers were cognizant of Glik's surveillance, knew that Glik was
using his phone to record them in some fashion, and were aware, based on
their asking Glik whether he was recording audio, that cell phones may
have sound recording capabilities. The fact that a cell phone may have
other functions is thus irrelevant to the question of whether Glik's
recording was "secret."

Appellants' argument reduces to the contention that, though they were
aware of Glik's recording, they initially thought Glik was taking
pictures of them rather than recording video and audio. This is almost
precisely the argument rejected by the four concurring justices in
Rivera, and it runs directly contrary to the logic of Hyde's "plain
view" discussion. Taking the appellants' argument to its logical end,
the Hyde defendant's recording would have escaped a wiretap offense only
if he had held his tape recorder in plain view and there was affirmative
evidence that the officers were aware that the device was switched on
and recording audio. To the contrary, Hyde makes the point that the use
in plain view of a device commonly known to record audio is, on its own,
sufficient evidence from which to infer the subjects' actual knowledge
of the recording. See 750 N.E.2d at 971 (noting that recording would not
have been secret under the statute if "the defendant had simply informed
the police of his intention to tape record the encounter, or even held
the tape recorder in plain sight" (emphasis added)). Simply put, a
straightforward reading of the statute and case law cannot support the
suggestion that a recording made with a device known to record audio and
held in plain view is "secret."

We thus conclude, on the facts of the complaint, that Glik's recording
was not "secret" within the meaning of Massachusetts's wiretap statute,
and therefore the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him.
Accordingly, the complaint makes out a violation of Glik's Fourth
Amendment rights.

\2. Was the Absence of Probable Cause Clearly Established Under the
Circumstances?

\

Appellants contend that, regardless of whether Glik's conduct in fact
violated the wiretap law, the state of the law was such that a
reasonable officer would not have understood that arresting Glik for a
wiretap offense under the circumstances alleged in the complaint would
violate Glik's Fourth Amendment rights. They point out, rightly, that a
lesser showing is required for an officer to be entitled to qualified
immunity from a Fourth Amendment claim based on a warrantless arrest
than to establish probable cause. See Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d 25, 31
(1st Cir. 2004). Officers are entitled to qualified immunity "so long as
the presence of probable cause is at least arguable." Ricci v. Urso, 974
F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Prokey v. Watkins, 942 F.2d 67, 72
(1st Cir. 1991)).

The presence of probable cause was not even arguable here. The
allegations of the complaint establish that Glik was openly recording
the police officers and that they were aware of his surveillance. For
the reasons we have discussed, we see no basis in the law for a
reasonable officer to conclude that such a conspicuous act of recording
was "secret" merely because the officer did not have actual knowledge of
whether audio was being recorded. We thus agree with the district court
that, at this stage in the litigation, the officers are not entitled to
qualified immunity from Glik's Fourth Amendment claim.

III.

For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court's order
denying appellants' claim of qualified immunity.

So ordered.
